# COIS-1020H
All programs, code, and notes from COIS1020H - Programming for Computer Science 

## Course Description
Programming for computing systems requires a solid foundation in the software development process, including algorithmic design, abstraction, implementation, testing and documentation. Core topics include sequencing, selection, iteration, simple data types, expressions and arrays, as well as the object-oriented notions of classes, methods, inheritance and polymorphism.

## Learning Outcomes
1. have a solid grasp of the concepts of object-oriented programming
2. be familiar with creating programs in C#
3. understand repetition and selection structures
4. have a solid foundation in the various types of parameter passing mechanisms
5. understand the concept of an array and how to use them in C#
6. recognize various searching and sorting techniques,
7. have the ability to design and implement algorithms to solve small- to medium-sized programming problems
8. be able to utilize debugging tools provided by the program development software interface
9. understand classes, objects, constructors, properties, and inheritance
